Welcome to SuperPortfolio! Here are the instructions for the app!

How to open the app: 

If you are on a mobile device, then tapping on the downloaded app will do the trick!
If you are on a computer device, you will need a mobile phone emulator for this to open (BlueStacks is the best one in our opinion, although you can decide)
Once you have a phone emulator downloaded, just right click the app apk file and select the "Open With" drop down menu and select your phone emulator.

How to use the app:

EDIT MODE: Edit mode is reached using the pencil icon on the bottom left of the screen. In this mode, you can edit all segments of your portfolio. 
You can change any image by selecting a photo from your photo gallery by pressing "Select Image" underneath the image you want to change. 
You can also take a photo from your phone camera by pressing the "Take Pic" button underneath the photo you want to set it to. 
By pressing the "Delete" button from underneath an image, you can remove the image above it. 
By selecting a text box indicated by its white background, you can edit any text box with your own text.
The checkboxes indicate whether or not the element can be visible in preview mode. By checking it, you make it visible, and by unchecking it, you make it invisible. 

PREVIEW MODE: Preview mode is how you can view what changes made in edit mode look like. Any change done in edit mode will be reflected in preview mode. 
Preview mode can be accessed through the eye in box icon on the bottom of your screen.

MENU: The main menu can be accessed through the three lines icon on the bottom right of your screen. The menu has five selections.
The first selection is the "Clear All Data" button. When you want to clear your existing portfolio, you can press this button to clear the data. 
It will ask you a second time when you press the button, however, just to make sure that you are certain you want to clear your existing portfolio.
The second selection is the "Read the Instructions" button, in which you can read the instructions of the app by clicking on it.
The third selection is the "Link your Twitter(X) Account" button. By clicking on it, you will get a prompt to type your username to link your account. 
By putting in a valid Twitter(now known as X) account username, it will then link your account to the Twitter(X) button at the bottom of the preview mode screen. 
By pressing that Twitter(X) button, you can access your desired account on Twitter(X) through your portfolio.
The fourth selection is the "Report a Bug" button. This button allows you to report any bug found in this app and send it to the developers. 
The text box allows you to describe the bug, and the submit button allows you to send the bug report to us.
The fifth and final selection is the "Documentation" button. 
Clicking on this button allows you to see what sources we got our images from, or how we created any images in this app, like for example the logo.
